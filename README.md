# Example JavaScript / CSS / HTML that helps Software Developers find Job Listings.

## Part of the Online ByteGrad Class

This Project was created alongside the ByteGrad Javascript class. This project is sample code that shows how to do the following:

*  Create a professional-standard CSS styled HTML page, that reacts to user events such as hovers, and uses up-to-date technology like flex-box.
* Uses Javascript to create a system that reacts to inputs in a dynamic and consistent way, using queries to the ByteGrad "Example Job Database"
* Demonstrates the use of the Browser Cache(Local Storage), State, as well as modular code design, written in vanilla Javascript.
* Allows for Job Searching, Pagination, Bookmarking, Hash-Link-Navigation, and sorting of Job entries.
* Demonstrates use of webpack, post-css, and babel to create a lightweight, well packaged, and universally-available  App.
